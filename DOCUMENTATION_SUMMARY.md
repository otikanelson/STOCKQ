## Building the AAB (Android App Bundle)

Since you asked about building AAB for Play Store submission, here's the quick guide:

### Step 1: Update eas.json (Already Done ✅)

I've already added the `production-aab` profile to your `eas.json`:

```json
{
  "production-aab": {
    "android": {
      "buildType": "app-bundle"
    },
    "env": {
      "EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL": "https://your-backend-url.vercel.app/api"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Update app.json (Already Done ✅)

I've already updated your `app.json`:
- Removed old `updates.url` (tied to old account)
- Removed `cli` field
- Added `owner: "neil2022"` for your new account

### Step 3: Build AAB

```bash
# 1. Logout and login to your new account
eas logout
eas login  # Login as neil2022

# 2. Build AAB for Play Store
eas build --platform android --profile production-aab --clear-cache
```

### Step 4: Download and Submit

1. Wait for build to complete (10-20 minutes)
2. Download the `.aab` file from EAS dashboard
3. Go to Google Play Console
4. Upload the AAB file
5. Fill in store listing details
6. Submit for review

**Note**: You can build AAB for free using EAS. No payment required for building. The $25 fee is only for Google Play Console registration (one-time).
